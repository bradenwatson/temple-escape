# Temple Escape
Temple Escape is a VR game where the player travels between rooms to find puzzle pieces to escape the level, while avoiding an enemy.

## Workflow
- **main** is for building to the VR headsets to test the progression.
- **development** is for combining the progression of the different teams together.
- **level-design, puzzle-design & enemy-design** are team branches used to combine the team's progression for testing.
- The individual branches under them are feature branches, these are used to work on tasks individually. They're to be named as the team's branch and your initials.
