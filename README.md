# templeEscape
**this whole read me file is temp and will most likely change if anyone wants it to - to make any changes make a seperate branch where only the readme file is touched and do a merge request**

# game description - not finished
a game where the player goes around from room to room finding pieces while avoiding the enemy.

# how the repo will function
- every group creates their own team branch
    - it is up to each group how they orginise there own branch

- when ever a feature is complete, like the design of a puzzle piece is complete or the intro maze design is finished, then make a merge request to main

- make sure your teams branch is always up to date with the main branch

- if you make a merge request to main branch send a message in the teams chat so everyone knows and is ready to update their own branches

# how to use github
## getting the repo onto your computers
## if Git Bash Here avaliable
1. find the URL to the repo - should look exactly like the image

![repo url image](/ReadMeImages/RepoUrl.jpg)

2. go into the folder you wish to insert the repo

3. open Git Bash Here

![git bash image](/ReadMeImages/GitBashOpening.jpg)

4. enter **git clone repoURL**

![clone code](/ReadMeImages/CloneCode.jpg)

5. wait for it to download and then open the repo and do what you want


## **_saving to github - ask person in team with most knowledge with github before continuing incase they want it done a different way_**

1. create a .gitignore inside the repo since you wont be able to push everything since its too large [(how to create a .gitignore)](#creating-a-gitignore)

## if doing it by **Git Bash Here**

2. open git bash inside the repo

3. create a new branch by entering - make a main branch for each team and decide per group how you will orginise it - only do if you need a new branch, not needed
``` 
git chechout -b new-branch-name 
```

4. enter into git bash here - only if the branch is newly created and has nothing on it
``` 
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
```

5. enter into **git bash here** - make sure the ignore file is complete before continuing in steps or wont work
``` 
git add .   
```

6. enter into **git bash here** 
``` 
git commit -m "your commit message. make sure its detailed"
```

8. make sure you are trying to save to right branch - to check it will say above the line you typing (its the same code as step 3 except without the -b and you say the name of the currently existing branch)

7. enter into **git bash here** 
``` 
git push
```

8. see if saved on github

will expand on this at a later date when merging branches is needed or other important things
