/*  Name: Tony Bui
 *  Purpose: User friendly map tool without needing to understand trees. Once a central room is 
 *          defined as the root, the class will connect all the rooms as a tree which can be 
 *          used to traverse and navigate and perform calculations. The map is designed to be 
 *          shared amongst the enemy and the player and interacting with the game manager.
 *  Last updated: 31/08/23
 *  Notes: 
    * Uses NTree and Room class
    * Uses enum called Compass which is used to indicate how list of child rooms are connected by index
